[This](vis/index.html) is a visualisation that is inflectable!

I can tell you something interesting about the [left](vis/index.html#vis=barchart&col=%2300F05E&yax=0;107.8&line=A;0;I;0.9;65.8;0;66.3;0&ann=C%3B0.5%3B97.3%3B0%3Ba%3A%20D%0Ab%3A%2091&high=D;91) bar.

And now you can see an explanation of [another](vis/index.html#vis=barchart&col=%2300F05E&yax=0;139.5&line=,A;0.1;I;0.9;60.3;0;60.3;0&ann=G%3B0.8%3B103%3B0%3Ba%3A%20H%0Ab%3A%2087&high=H;87) bar.


And this is a [columnchart](vis/index.html#vis=columnchart&col=%2300F05E&xax=0;23952095.8&line=8203592.8;0;11916167.7;0;75;0.3;85;0.4&ann=15568862.3%3B0%3B90%3B0.4%3Bpopulation%3A%208977000&high=8977000;70) now!

And this is a [stacked barchart](vis/index.html#vis=stacked_barchart) now!

Look, a [scatterplot!](vis/index.html#vis=scatterplot&col=%2300F05E&yax=4.5;54.5&xax=20.36;259.86&line=&ann=153.3%3B0%3B34.3%3B0%3B132&high=132;32.7)

Linguistically speaking an [inflection](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inflection) refers to a modification of a word to convey grammatical information.

We are trying to adjust visualizations for the purpose of explanation and argumentation. Let's try it out with some existing visualizations…

[Beautiful Trouble](https://mariandoerk.de/monadicexploration/demo/#-1:00000) is a book for activists, organizers, and anyone interested in creating social change.

With this visual interface, the chapters can be navigated in a relational way.

[Each entry is connected with many other chapters.](https://mariandoerk.de/monadicexploration/demo/#200158:00000) Those that are more related are pulled towards the center.

For example, [points of intervention](https://mariandoerk.de/monadicexploration/demo/#300204:00000) is a theory that refers to specific situations where change becomes possible.

The tactic of [prefigurative intervention](https://mariandoerk.de/monadicexploration/demo/#100239:00000) is to graspably foreshadow the good things to come in the future…

The book combines [five types of chapters](https://mariandoerk.de/monadicexploration/demo/#-1:00000): tactics, principles, theories, case studies, and profiles of practitioners to offer a toolkit for confronting injustice and advocating for progressive causes.

It is possible to focus on a subset, e.g., just the [tactics, principles, and theories](https://mariandoerk.de/monadicexploration/demo/#-1:00011).

[EdgeMaps](https://mariandoerk.de/edgemaps/demo/#phils;map;;) is a visualization technique that integrates the representation of explicit and implicit data relations. Explicit relations are specific connections between entities already present in a given dataset, while implicit relations are based on the similarity measures derived from shared properties in multidimensional data. EdgeMaps combine spatialization and graph drawing techniques to visualize both types of relations. By activating only one node at a time and distinguishing between incoming and outgoing edges, interesting visual patterns emerge resembling fireworks and waves.

[Karl Marx](https://mariandoerk.de/edgemaps/demo/#phils;map;;/en/karl_marx)

[Immanuel Kant](https://mariandoerk.de/edgemaps/demo/#phils;map;;/en/immanuel_kant)

[Hannah Arendt](https://mariandoerk.de/edgemaps/demo/#phils;map;;/en/hannah_arendt)

[Close-up Cloud](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/closeupcloud/#/viz) enables the viewer to visually explore a collection of historical glass negatives. The overview of close-ups encourages familiarity with the collection and facilitates exploration of its wealth of detail. The sizes of the images illustrate the quantitative distribution of iconographic details in the collection. The close-ups serve as visual navigation elements, enabling the user to explore the collection.
